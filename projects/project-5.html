    <h1>Project 5 — Optical Illusion</h1>

    <p>
      This optical illusion uses many dots arranged along circular paths that continuously change 
      their size, color, and position. These subtle shifts create a strong illusion of motion and depth, 
      making the screen feel alive and almost three-dimensional. I also think this could work well as 
      a live phone wallpaper because of its calm but dynamic visual effect.
